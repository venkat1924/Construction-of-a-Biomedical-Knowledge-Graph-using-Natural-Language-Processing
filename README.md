# Construction of a Biomedical Knowledge Graph using Natural Language Processing
 
This repository contains code and resources for constructing a **Biomedical Knowledge Graph** (BKG) from scientific literature using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It implements an end-to-end pipelineâ€”from PDF text extraction and preprocessing, through Named Entity Recognition (NER) and co-occurrence analysis, to graph storage and querying in Neo4j. The corresponding paper describes the methodology, experiments, and results in detail.

## Features

* **OCR-based PDF extraction** using `pdf2image` and `pytesseract` to convert research articles into raw text.
* **Text cleaning** with NLTK to remove headers, figure captions, and normalize content.
* **Biomedical NER** leveraging the BERN2 API for multi-type entity recognition and linking.
* **Co-occurrence analysis** to identify relationships between entities within a sliding window.
* **Graph construction** in Neo4j, including nodes for authors, articles, sentences, and entities, and relationships for mentions and co-occurrence.
* **Graph-powered applications** such as search engine queries, author expertise inspection, and potential integration with machine learning via node embeddings.
